# NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
#
# a powerful N-dimensional array object
# sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
# tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
# useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

from numpy import *

arr = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
# [1 2 3 4 5]
